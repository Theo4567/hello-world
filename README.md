Hi!  My name is Alan.  I am 33 years old and have worked in finance for the last 13 years.  I graduated from Transylvania in 2005 and took a break from school.  I then went back to law school and graduated in Dec. 2015.  I sat for the Feb. 2016 bar exam and passed the first time.  This was while I started a Masters in Accountancy and was still working full-time.  Outside of school and work, I love the outdoors and working out.
